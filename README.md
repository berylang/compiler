# The Bery Programming Language

Bery is a compiled, statically typed, object-oriented programming language designed for performance and clarity. Built completely from scratch with a custom C++ frontend and an LLVM backend, Berry compiles directly to highly optimized native machine code.

This project is a **Learning Project** by team of six undergraduate engineers.

## Proof of Our Philosophy
Bery is a learning project, that's why it is a proof of our CONCEPT CLEARANCE. The team operates under strict constraints:
1. **Zero AI Assistance**
2. **Transperancy in Communication**
3. **Strict Validation**

## State of Project
Currently Bery is in active development stage. Every member is contributing something new for each day.

## File Extension
Bery source code files has `.bry` extension. e.g. `main.bry`, `run.bry`, etc.

## Architecture

Project pipeline follows :
1. **Lexer** : (`src/lexer/..`) It scans the source code of Bery and and tokenize it.
2. **Parser** : (`src/parer/..`) It constructs the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) using a Top-Down recursive Descent Approach.
3. **Semantic Analyzer** : (`src/sema/..`) It traverse the whole AST for type-checking, scope resolution, implicit type casting, etc.
4. **Codegen** : (`src/codegen/..`) It translates the validated AST directly into LLVM IR via explicit hardware instructions and basic  control flow.
